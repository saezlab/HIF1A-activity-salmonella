# Response of HIF1A activity to salmonella infection

## Abstract
TODO

## About
This repository contains exclusively the script for the transcriptome analysis of salmonella infected mice. The analysis comprises, differential gene expression analysis, inference of TF activities with special focus on the TF HIF1A/Hif1a ([dorothea](http://saezlab.github.io/dorothea/)) and pathway analysis (using [progeny](http://saezlab.github.io/progeny/))

## Data access
The salmonella dataset was generated by third parties and is publicly available on GEO. It can be accessed via the accession ID [GSE19174](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE19174).
