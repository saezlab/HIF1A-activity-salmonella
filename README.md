# Response of HIF1A to salmonella infection

## Abstract
TODO

## About
This repository contains exclusively the [script](https://github.com/saezlab/HIF1A-activity-salmonella/blob/master/hif1a_salmonella_notebook.Rmd) for the transcriptome analysis of salmonella infected mice. The analysis comprises, differential gene expression analysis, inference of TF activities with special focus on the TF HIF1A/Hif1a (using [dorothea](http://saezlab.github.io/dorothea/)) and pathway analysis (using [progeny](http://saezlab.github.io/progeny/)).

## Results
A rendered version of the markdown document can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/saezlab/HIF1A-activity-salmonella/raw/master/hif1a_salmonella_notebook.html).

## Data access
The salmonella dataset was generated by third parties and is publicly available on GEO. It can be accessed via the accession ID [GSE19174](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE19174).
